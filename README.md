My original breakdown of the construction of my minigame- The breakdown was separated into 3 large squares which represent the classes that were required in the game: the player class  (component of the player GameObject), the coin class (Component of the coin prefab), and the game controller class (Component of the canvas gameobject). The inside of the large square carried the variables or attributes of each class; though there were some variables I had not accounted for in my original breakdown model. In the player class, the attributes within it were the player’s transform (_playertransform), the player’s rigid body (rb_), a float to specify the power of the player’s jump (jumpforce_), and a bool to indicate if the player is on the ground (isGrounded_). In the coin class, its attributes consist of the coin's collider (Collider), a float to assign how fast the coins are moving through the game screen (moveSpeed), and a float to indicate the specific position the coin despawns (DestroyPosition). Finally within the Game Controller class carried attributes such as The text for the points UI (Pointtext), an integer that can track and count the amount of points the player has collected (points), and the coin prefab (coinprefab) as well as variables that represent how long it takes til another coin spawns (spawntime) and the range of where the coin spawns (spawnmin/spawnmax). The last aspect of the breakdown model is the arrows which show how certain classes had to interact with each other or the certain methods needed within each class. For example, the player class uses a Jump() method that uses the player’s rigidbody (rb_) and jumpforce_ to make the player jump when the space bar is hit- there is also an OnCollisionEnter2D() method that uses the isGrounded attribute as well as the tag of the ground game object to identity if the player is on the ground and can jump since the logic of the jump() method only allows the player to jump if they’re detected on the ground (no double jumping). Some other examples of actions and methods that were needed are a SpawnCoin() method for the Game Controller Class that used spawnmin and spawnmax to spawn th coinprefab in a random x position (by using Random.Range() ), The UpdateScore() method that was called when a coin was collected by the player which added 1 to the points variable and showed it in the Pointtext UI and a OnTriggerEnter2D() method for the coin class that detected when the player had collided with the coins collider and as a result destroy the coin GameObject. 

Through understanding how the breakdown correlates to the coding and construction of the game I learned that these breakdowns need to account for everything- all the minor details and by looking at the smaller puzzle pieces that make up a certain action I’m able to see how much attributes really are necessary for the game’s mechanics.
